# celestia-core-rpc-rs

A Rust implementation of the core types returned by a Celestia Core node's RPC
endpoint. These can be used to deserialize JSON-RPC responses.

All networking related features will be feature guarded to keep the
dependencies small in cases where only the core types are needed.
